# canvasShapes
[![canvasshapes logo](img/canvasShapes-logo.png "CanvasShapes GitHub page")](http://guerratron.github.io/canvasShapes "CanvasShapes page")
 It is a library for drawing geometric figures associated events.  
 
 It shows geometric calculations (areas, perimeters, ...) and supports a free drawn mode *"freehand"*; also it has a graphical interface with buttons bar and an options window where display / modify some of the multiple parameters supported.  
 
 *'CANVAS-SHAPES'* is actually a namespace that hold the library **'PolyArea'** which is responsible for the bulk of drawn figures, but also houses objects and methods useful in separate modules.  
 HTML element works on a *'canvas'* that constructs itself and on which it has implemented a reception event for the creation and modified the figures (points, segments, ...)

## Usage
After loading the file in the *'head'* zone (`<script src = "... / canvasShapes.js" ...> </ script>`) you can start to use the library under the namespace: *'canvasShapes'*. It could commence for example, with the viewing of the UI by the method:

    canvasShapes.render( {id: "idElement"} );
 
where the string *'idElement'* is expected that identifies the container element, that is, the element in which all imbibing *UI*.  
From here everything is done visually and interactively in the **GUI**.

## Features:
- OOP Philosophy, classes, inheritance, modularity, abstraction, ...
- *ECMASCRIPT* 6 features: `"use-strict"`.
- Cross-Browser.
- Modularity and abstraction by js-modules and Closures.
- Grouping of modules in a single file to simplify the call in the *'head'*.
- Self-content CSS, *media-queries*, *'bootstrap'* patterns.
- *OUTSTANDING !!* : Assigning events to the figures in the *'canvas'*.  
 This is really **INNOVATIVE** and that everyone knows that drawn on a canvas does not allow events, since 
 they are not objects, but the library does implement recognizing the figures drawn as objects.
